My current work at MIT focuses on developing probabilistic, hyper-resolution flood-inundation risk maps for vulnerable regions worldwide—such as Bangladesh, Southeast Florida, Puerto Rico, and Boston—under various climate scenarios, using a multidisciplinary, ML-accelerated downscaling–hydrodynamic modeling framework. This research addresses the impacts of climate extremes—particularly tropical cyclones, seasonal extreme rainfall, and sea-level rise—and aims to empower frontline communities by enhancing disaster resilience, strengthening coastal strategies, and advancing climate adaptation.

I summarize my past, current, and future work into four themes:

### 1. Integrated ocean--estuary--river-network hydrodynamics for tide--surge--inflow coupling
Unified, multi-scale domains connect shelves, estuaries, and dense river networks to capture nonlinear tide–surge–river interactions that standard coastal models miss; methods include open, reproducible meshing/workflows. See *Earth’s Future* ([link](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021EF002638)) for the Pearl River Delta and *One Earth* ([link](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(25)00099-5)) for Bangladesh. I also developed a physics-informed rating-curve framework for upstream discharge reconstruction; see *Journal of Hydrology* ([link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169421002158)) and *Advances in Water Science* ([link](http://skxjz.nhri.cn/en/article/doi/10.14042/j.cnki.32.1309.2020.02.007)).

### 2. Physics-based storm-tide risk assessment for mega-deltas under warming scenarios
To quantify future storm-tide risk, I use storyline-based stress testing and TC downscaling–hydrodynamic chains to estimate design water levels (e.g., 50–1,000-yr) and long-horizon risk under sea-level rise and evolving cyclone characteristics, with explicit uncertainty for adaptation. See *Earth’s Future* ([link](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021EF002638)) and *One Earth* ([link](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(25)00099-5)).

### 3. Hyper-resolution compound/cascading flood mapping for frontline adaptation (ongoing work)
Fast hydrodynamics, TC and rainfall downscaling, and active-learning triage produce ~30 m inundation layers integrating surge, tides, river inflow, and extreme rainfall—including multi-event cascades—for decision-ready community products.

### 4. Post-landfall flood early warning at basin–city scales (future direction)
I am developing an operational pipeline that links week-ahead TC forecasts to rapid inundation prediction for emergency response (coupling pluvial–fluvial–coastal dynamics to generate compound/cascading inundation maps).
