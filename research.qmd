### Tropical-cyclone downscaling + hydrodynamic inundation
Bangladesh & SE U.S.; coupling surge, waves, rainfall, riverine flow.

### Compound & cascading hazards
Risk mapping; ML-accelerated extreme search; adaptive decision-making.

### Hydrology & rating-curve uncertainty
Bayesian / nonstationary methods; stage–discharge modeling.
