## Short Bio
I am a Postdoctoral Associate at *MIT/EAPS* (since Apr 2023), working with Dr. Sai Ravela and Prof. Kerry Emanuel.
My research focuses on integrated tropical-cyclone–related flood risk under climate change, combining a downscaling–hydrodynamic
inundation framework with machine learning for compound extremes. Current topics include adaptive decision-making for
infrastructure–human systems; coupled hydrological–hydrodynamic inundation modeling; assessment of compound and cascading
flood risks; TC–environment interactions; flood extent detection; and climate impacts on the earth–human system.
