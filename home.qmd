<p>I'm a Postdoctoral Associate at <em>MIT/EAPS</em> (since Apr 2023), working with Dr. Sai Ravela and Prof. Kerry Emanuel.
My research focuses on integrated tropical-cyclone–related flood risk under climate change, combining a
downscaling–hydrodynamic inundation framework with machine learning for compound extremes. Current interests span
adaptive decision-making for infrastructure–human systems; coupled hydrological–hydrodynamic inundation modeling;
assessment of compound and cascading flood risks; TC–environment interactions; flood extent detection; and climate
impacts on the earth–human system.</p>
