My research interests broadly span physical oceanography, atmospheric science, and terrestrial hydrology, with a particular emphasis on ocean–atmosphere–land interactions.\n\n\nMy current work focuses on developing hyper-resolution flood inundation risk maps for vulnerable regions such as Bangladesh, Southeast Florida, Puerto Rico, and Boston, using a multidisciplinary, downscaling–hydrodynamic modeling framework accelerated by machine learning. This research addresses the impacts of weather and climate extremes—particularly tropical cyclones, seasonal extreme rainfall, and sea-level rise—and aims to empower frontline communities by enhancing disaster resilience, strengthening coastal strategies, and advancing climate adaptation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment\n\nApr 2023 – Present, Postdoctoral Associate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n\n\nEducation\n\nSep 2018 – Dec 2022, Ph.D., Physical Geography, Sun Yat-sen University\nMay 2021 – Jun 2022, Ph.D. (CSC joint-educated, 1 yr), National University of Singapore\nSep 2016 – Jun 2018, M.Eng., Hydraulic Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University\nSep 2012 – Jun 2016, B.Eng., Hydraulic & Hydropower Engineering, China Three Gorges University"
